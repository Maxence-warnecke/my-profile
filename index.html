    <div class="introduction">
        <p>I live in Neuilly sur Seine, I'm 18 years old and I study in a business school which is located close to my city and which is named Ieseg. I love to play sports and to discover new people.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <div class="hobby coding">
            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>My experience with coding has always been one of new discovery! I am always getting into some new programming languages and frameworks to better my skills. I embrace every opportunity to learn and create through coding, whether it is developing dynamic Web applications or attempting to solve complex problems.</p>

        <div class="hobby downhill">
            <h3>Downhill Bike</h3>
            <p>Downhill biking is very exhilarating: racing down those twisty trails fills you with a sense of freedom. I do love recalling that shot of adrenaline every ride provides in whichever glorious view I am surrounded by. Just a perfect medium for me to live amidst nature.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="hobby climbing">
            <h3>Climbing</h3>
            <p>Climbing is my other passion that combines adventure with fitness. From indoor bouldering to climbing outdoor rock faces, I love the unique mental and physical challenges it provides. Climbing requires the same kind of focus and determination that I employ while coding, so it is quite fulfilling.</p>
